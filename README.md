# Dev Tools for 2.80

I found that the developer documentation links in 2.80 still point to the documentation pages for 2.79 and decided to add my own shortcuts.  Additionally, this addon can act as a repository for quickly publishing any other ideas for tools or features that can assist with the development of addons.

To bring up the new documentation window, press `Shift + ?`.  From here, you should see a pop-up with shortcuts to several pages in the API documentation, as well as, the ability to enter search criteria and jump straight to the search results page.
